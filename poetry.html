<h3>In the following section, we have provided a comprehensive guideline for Poetry Submissions with the following sub sections: 
<br><br>
Regulations <br>
Evaluation Guidelines<br>
Theme/Prompt<br>
Uploading Your Work<br>
</h3>
<br>
<h2>Regulations</h2>
<br>
In order to submit to the Visual Arts form, you must be above 16 years old to submit. The following are guidelines that apply to submissions: 
<br><br>
Up to four poems submitted within a singular document. The document should be not exceed eight pages
Please do not put your name on your submission document. You will be asked to enter your name within the submission form. The document/file you submit should not contain your name.
At this time, Lekhani does not accept translations.  
<br><br>
NOTE: We are currently not accepting any submissions that incorporate moving components such as in the case of videos, voice recordings, gifs, animations, documentaries, etc. In the future, however, this guideline may change to incorporate moving components.
<br><br>
You may use any medium or mediums to create your work provided that it follows the guidelines above and adheres to the theme provided. 
<br><br>
<h2>Evaluation Guidelines</h2>
<br>
Lekhani particularly encourages South Asian artists to submit as part of an effort to share their voices on its platform. However, we welcome submissions from people of all backgrounds and ethnicities! 
For the current theme regarding bodies, we hope to evaluate based on the following factors in order of highest to lowest importance: 
<br><br>
How closely the submission piece relates to the theme provided
How creatively the artist expresses their interpretation of the theme (separate from skill)
How the artist personally integrates themselves or the world into their artwork
The skill of the artist (while good art is subjective, we still consider skill into consideration)
<br><br>
<h2>Theme/Prompt</h2>
<br>
You are welcome to any interpretation of the theme/prompt as long as its connection to your work can be traced. In the Visual Arts Submission Form, we have provided you with a space to write a description of your work. We prefer that your description is short and concise, not exceeding 5-6 sentences. 
<br><br>
<h2>Uploading Your Work</h2>
<br>
You may submit up to 4 submissions, however, should your artwork be selected for our magazine, only one submission will be chosen per person.
<br><br>
Please title your file as such:  
FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_TITLE.png/jpg/jpeg (one of these file formats) 
<br><br>
Please use this exact format to title your file as it will make the process of examining submissions much easier. 
<br><br>
The submissions form will only allow you to submit one artwork at a time. So, for multiple submissions, please keep personal information the same so that we may be able to correctly identify you as the creator of the submissions. 
<br><br>
NOTE: The email that you will provide when submitting the form will be the email you will be contacted through by Lekhani. 
<br><br>
