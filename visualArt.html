<h3 >In the following section, we have provided a comprehensive guideline for Visual Arts Submissions with the following sub sections: 
<br>
<br>General Guidelines
<br>Uploading your work
<br>Evaluation Guidelines
</h3>
<br>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<br>
In order to submit to the Visual Arts form, you must be above 16 years old to submit. The following are guidelines that apply to submissions: 
<br><br>
Please submit up to four pieces in a single submissions cycle. If we receive any more than four submissions, any submissions after the fourth (based on date/time of submission) will be disregarded. 
You are welcome to any interpretation of the theme/prompt as long as its connection to your work can be traced. Despite Lekhani having a theme in place, we hold importance to the freedom of art and the artist â€“ feel free to experiment or stray from the standard box of the theme. 
In the Visual Arts Submission Form, we have provided you with a space to write a description of your work. We prefer that your description is short and concise, not exceeding 5-6 sentences.
Lekhani only accepts original artwork of the artist. Please do not submit anything along the lines of recreations or AI art.  
<br><br>
NOTE: We are currently not accepting any submissions that incorporate moving components such as in the case of videos, voice recordings, gifs, animations, documentaries, etc. In the future, however, this guideline may change to incorporate moving components. You may use any medium or mediums to create your work provided that it follows the guidelines above and adheres to the theme provided. 
<br><br>
<h2>Uploading Your Work</h2>
<br>
You may submit up to 4 submissions, however, should your artwork be selected for our magazine, only one submission will be chosen per person.
<br><br>
Please title your file as such:  <br>
FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_TITLE.png/jpg/jpeg (one of these file formats) 
<br><br>
Please use this exact format to title your file as it will make the process of examining submissions much easier. 
<br><br>
The submissions form will only allow you to submit one artwork at a time. So, for multiple submissions, please keep personal information the same so that we may be able to correctly identify you as the creator of the submissions. 
<br><br>
NOTE: The email that you will provide when submitting the form will be the email you will be contacted through by Lekhani. 
<br><br>
Submissions are currently being accepted from ______ at ____ until ______ at _____. 
<br><br>
<h2>Evaluation Guidelines</h2>
<br>
Lekhani particularly encourages South Asian artists to submit as part of an effort to share their voices on its platform. However, we welcome submissions from those who identify as people of color from all backgrounds and ethnicities! 
<br><br>
For the current theme regarding bodies, we hope to evaluate based on the following factors: 
<br><br>
1. How closely the submission piece relates to the theme provided<br>
2. How creatively the artist expresses their interpretation of the theme (separate from skill)<br>
3. How the artist personally integrates themselves or the world into their artwork<br><br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">We are excited to see the wonderful work you do!</h2>
